<!--Transitions : 
    In hover, color changes instantly, but in transition, color changes slowly and gradually

    transition property:
    It is a shorthand property.

    Transition-timing-function: ease-in;
    The transition starts slowly, and accelerates gradually until the end.

    Transition-timing-funxtion: ease-in-out;
    The transition starts quickly, and accelerates gradually until the end.

    Transition-timing-function: linear;
    The transition has a "constant speed"
