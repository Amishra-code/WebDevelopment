<!--
    STRUCTURE OF A WEBSITE

    There are two types of tags : 
    a.)Semantic tags
    b.)Non-Semantic tags

    a.)SEMANTIC TAGS : 
     Tags which clearly defines contents
     e.g: <h1>, <h6>, <Nav>
     Following are the semantic tags described below-

    1.<header> ->
        contains logo, heading, tagline

    2.<Nav> ->
        contains menu, used to show the navigation information of webpage
    
    3.<main>
        this is the main area of the web page and consists of subsections and comes under the body tag

    4.<article> ->
        used to create blog.
    
    5.<section> ->
        contains single piece of functionality.
    
    6.<aside> ->
        related videos which comes under the web page on a side like you tube videos or any adds comes under the aside tag.

    7.<footer> ->
        this is used at the end of the web page and we usually put the copyright, contact info in this footer tag.
    

    Some tags in the semnatic tags tells nothing about the content
    
    i)<div> : used to group some contents like grouping 2 or three paragraphs.
    Div is block level element.
    e.g: if we want to change the background color of 3 paragraphs so rather than changing the color for each para, we will group those paras using the <div> and will change the color 

    ii)<Span> : Soan is inline level element
