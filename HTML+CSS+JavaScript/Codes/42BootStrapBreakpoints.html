<!--Breakpoints are the triggers in BootStrap for how your layout responsive changes across device or viewport size.

    i)Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design.
    ii)Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint
    iii)Mobile first, responsive design is the goal

// X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
// No media query for `xs` since this is the default in Bootstrap

// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

// X-Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }

// XX-Large devices (larger desktops, 1400px and up)
@media (min-width: 1400px) { ... }

CONTAINERS:
Containers are a fundamental building block of BootStrap that contain, pad, and align your content within given device or viewport.
BootStrap comes with three different containers:
i) .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint.
ii) .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
iii) .container-{breakpoint}, which is width : 100% until the specified breakpoint.

e.g: if we create navigation bar or anhything like that, we keep them inside containers
